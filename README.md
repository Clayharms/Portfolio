# Data Analyst Portfolio

## Overview

This portfolio contains several data projects that demonstrate my skills and experience as a data analyst. The projects showcase my ability to query data using SQL, analyze data in Excel, and create visualizations in Tableau.

## Project Details

### BikeStores Data Analysis

For this project, I used SQL to query data from the BikeStores database and imported the results into Excel. From there, I created several pivot tables and graphs to analyze the data. I then created a dashboard in Tableau to visualize the key insights from the data. The link to the Tableau dashboard can be found in the [` tableau bikestores link.html `](https://github.com/Clayharms/Portfolio/blob/main/tableau%20bikestores%20link.html) file.

### SQLQuery1BikeStores

This file contains the SQL query I used to extract data from the BikeStores database for the BikeStores Data Analysis project. You can view the code in the [`SQLQuery1BikeStores.sql`](https://github.com/Clayharms/Portfolio/blob/main/SQLQuery1BikeStores.sql) file.

### BikeStores.xlsx

This file contains the Excel data that was extracted from the BikeStores database using SQL for the BikeStores Data Analysis project. You can view the file in the [` BikeStores.xlsx `](https://github.com/Clayharms/Portfolio/blob/main/BikeStores.xlsx) file.

## Conclusion

I hope these projects give you an idea of my skills and experience as a data analyst. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities.
