# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find some of the projects I have worked on as a data analyst.

## BikeStores Project

For this project, I used SQL to query certain tables so that I could upload them to Excel for further analysis. Once in Excel, I created several pivot tables. From these pivot tables, I created a dashboard with several graphs. Once this was done, I uploaded the Excel data to Tableau and created another dashboard there.

## Covid-19 Tableau Dashboard

Here I took COVID-19 data from an Excel spreadsheet and created a dashboard called "Global Vaccine Tracker" which looked at certain KPIs like "people partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated" and vaccinations over GDP.

## SimpleCycles Project

My last project "SimpleCycles.xlsx" was another bicycle-related Excel project where I just used Excel to analyze bike sales for a bike store. I looked at things like average income per purchase, customer age, customer commute, and used data slicers to make the dashboard interactive.
